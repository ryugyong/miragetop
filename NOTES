brew edit ocaml
to add:
    system "make", "ocamlnat"
not sure this is necessary but i added it too:
    system "make", "installoptopt", "PREFIX=#{prefix}"

$ brew install -s ocaml # to install from source

Then you just have to fix up the META file.
Changed the requires line in package "toplevel" to:
  requires = "compiler-libs.optcomp,compiler-libs.bytecomp"


i think that was all

oh the compiler-libs/META file is ~/.opam/default/lib/compiler-libs/META
